# 🧠 AI-Based Resume Screening for Job Roles

A **machine learning–powered intelligent system** for automated resume screening, classification, and skill assessment.  
This project combines **BERT-based embeddings** with **custom feature extraction** and an **XGBoost classifier** to predict the most suitable job role for a given resume.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Traditional resume screening is time-consuming and prone to human bias.  
This project automates the process by leveraging **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **AI-based feature engineering** to classify resumes into specific job roles and generate skill-based analytics.

## 🧩 Core Features

| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| 🧠 **Transformer Embeddings (BERT)** | Uses `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model from Sentence Transformers for contextual text encoding |
| 🧮 **XGBoost Classifier** | Classifies resumes into predefined job roles with high accuracy |
| 🧰 **4 Novel Features** | Extracts unique candidate insights such as experience, skills, resume quality, and candidate score |
| 📄 **Resume Parsing (PDF)** | Reads resumes directly from uploaded PDF files using `PyPDF2` |
| 📊 **Explainability** | Displays feature importance and confusion matrix for transparency |
| 💾 **Model Persistence** | Saves trained model, encoder, and evaluation metrics for reuse |
| 🌐 **GitHub Integration** | Pushes trained model and outputs to your GitHub repository directly from Colab |
